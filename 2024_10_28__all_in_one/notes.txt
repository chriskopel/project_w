Maybe we re-structure this so that we keep the data locally and don't have to scrape every call.
-lots of obv. positives
-downside is data will not be as up to date
-- for this we can run an upsert script once a week(?) to refresh periodically


Steps:
1. Grab as much data as possible for all the leagues
2. Insert into a consolidated csv
3. Build upsert script
