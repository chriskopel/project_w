-Test:
 - scrape
  - done
 - org and save
  - done

-Build a method in the same library to upload the selected file to gsheets
 - need to create a gsheet for this 
  - make sure to add the account email to the allowed editor

Future Notes:
-- For the FB scrape, maybe try opening one window and then redirecting to the new url once data is grabbed instead of of closing and opening every time, then we'll only have to reject cookies once and everything should go quicker
-- Lots of warnings for the date/time inference when reading in the pandas dfs for the organize_data() method (FutureWarning: The argument 'date_parser', UserWarning: Could not infer format, etc.)

Maybe we re-structure this so that we keep the data locally and don't have to scrape every call.
-lots of obv. positives
-downside is data will not be as up to date
-- for this we can run an upsert script once a week(?) to refresh periodically


Steps:
1. Grab as much data as possible for all the leagues
2. Insert into a consolidated csv
3. Build upsert script
